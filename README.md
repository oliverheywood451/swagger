# OrderCloud Swagger

This is a repository for the OrderCloud API [Swagger Spec](http://swagger.io/specification) and all the generated SDK's. 

# How to Regenerate 

TODO: Included more detailed instructions on how to generating the SDK's works. For now, just generate the spec from the C# API, then run it through Swagger code-gen to generate all the libraries you want. 

# Folder Structure 

The `sdk` folder includes all the languages that have generated sdk's.

The `templates` folder contains any custom templates made to generate the OrderCloud sdk's (such as for tweaking syntax or adding in built-in authentication or other things specific to our API)
